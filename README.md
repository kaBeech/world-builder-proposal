# Proposal

## Technical Guidelines

### We like tools that are:

- Simple to start using

- Modifiable and extenadable

## App

A server that stores and serves up world building data

The necessary components (Primal Structures and User Assets) are simple and few but can be combined to create detailed world-building structures

Project Templates (i.e. Database Structures) can  saved and duplicated/copied

Projects or individual Project Assets can be duplicated/copied

Each Project Asset will have designator set to either Formal or Local
    - Formal assets are essentially the default form of the asset, absent from any copyrightable game 
    - Formal assets must not contain game mechanics that are not in the Public Domain (or at least strongly Open Source - to be considered)
    - Formal assets will have pointers to their formal dependencies (for licensing reasons)

Primal Structures, marked in the Database Structure with an asterisk, are necessary in every Project
