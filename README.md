# Proposal

## Technical Guidelines

### We like tools that are:

- Simple to start using

- Modifiable and extenadable

## App

A server that stores and serves up world building data

The necessary components (Primal Structures and User Assets) are simple and few but can be combined to create detailed world-building structures

Project Assets can be copied

<!-- Formal assets are essentially the default form of the asset -->
<!-- Formal will have pointers to their formal dependencies -->
<!-- Formal assets will have a designator whether or not their formal dependencies are Public Domain (or at least strongly Open Source - to be considered) -->
<!-- Necessary Components are marked in the Database Structure with an asterisk -->
<!-- Primal Structures are Necessary Components that are not User Assets -->
